This repository contains code used to build the textual corpus of my second empirical method of large-n text-as-data content analysis, which tracked the prevalence of Chinese-associated normative frames in FOCAC member UN General Debate speeches from 1993-2024. 

These materials were used to aid the completion of my undergraduate senior thesis for the Government Department (March 2026). Happy coding! :)
